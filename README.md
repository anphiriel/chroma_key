## chroma_key: Chroma Key Compositor Demo App

This repository showcases a demonstration of greenscreen (chroma‐key) compositing using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter. 

---

### Overview

1. **`chroma_key_core.py`**
   - Contains the **core chroma‐key and compositing logic** (greenscreen removal).  
   - Implements the primary function `perform_chroma_key(...)` to blend a foreground (greenscreen) video with a background (image or second video).  
   - Includes an **optional advanced feature** `apply_gamma_correction(...)` for demonstrating color adjustment expertise.  
   - Strictly computational routines—no GUI code here.

3. **`chroma_key_gui.py`**
   - Provides a **Tkinter‐based interface** for loading videos, picking the key color, adjusting various parameters (tolerance, softness, brightness, contrast), and exporting the final composited video.  

---

### Key Features

1. **Greenscreen Removal**  
   - Dynamically pick a target color (e.g. green) to remove from the foreground video.  
   - Control the tolerance range and softness of edges (feathering) to achieve seamless compositing.

2. **Foreground & Background Adjustments**  
   - Brightness and contrast sliders for both the foreground and the background.  
   - Fine‐tune overall look, ensuring a cohesive final composite.

3. **Preview & Export**  
   - **Play** the fully composited video in real-time (or approx).  
   - **Export** final video.

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download** this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/chroma_key.git
cd chroma_key
```

2. **Dependencies**: 
	- Python >= 3.7
	- OpenCV (opencv-python)
	- NumPy
	- Tkinter (often included with Python on Windows/macOS; on some Linux distros, install python3-tk)

Install via pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

3. **Run the App**: 
```bash
python chroma_key_gui.py
```

### Usage

1. **Load Foreground Video**
   - Click “Load Foreground Video” and select a .mp4 file, ideally with a greenscreen or solid background.

3. **Pick Chroma Key Color**
   - Optionally click “Pick Chroma Key Color” to open a window where you drag a bounding box around the background color to remove. The default is set to green.

5. **Load Background**
   - Click “Load Background” and choose either Image or Video as the source.
   - If video, frames are preloaded for short background clips.
   - If image, it remains static throughout the composite.

7. **Adjust Sliders**
   - Tolerance: how wide the color range is around the chosen key color.
   - Edge Softness: the blur/feather around edges for seamless compositing.
   - Color Spill: reduce any green or color cast on the foreground subject.
   - Brightness / Contrast: separate sliders for foreground and background.

9. **Preview**
    - Click “Preview Composited Video” to watch the entire video with the background replaced.
    - If “Reverse Background” is checked, the background video frames are played in reverse.
    - Expect some delay of the preview video on lower-performing devices (final export after processing is standard speed).

11. **Export**
    - Click “Export Composited Video” to render and save the final output.
